## Snake Game in Different Languages

This repository will contain different implementations of the snake game.
With the semester being over, I have too much time on my hands and I
thought it would be nice to compare some basic GUI funcionalities between
different languages.

So far, the repo contains code for Java and Python. In the future, I will be
adding a JS implementation (that will come very soon as it should be quite
easy) and an implementation with a functional language (still haven't decided
which one to use but will probably opt for Haskell).

The structure of the repository is fairly straightforward. There should be
one folder per language implementation.
