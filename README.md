## Snake Game in Different Languages

This repository will contain different implementations of the snake game.
I thought it would be nice to compare some basic GUI functionalities between
a few very common languages. At the same time, this will serve as a nice
refresher for me when it comes to GUI programming in general.

So far, the repo contains Java, Python and JS versions. In the future, I will
be adding a functional programming implementation as well, probably written in
Haskell.

The structure of the repository is fairly straightforward. There should be
one folder per language implementation.
